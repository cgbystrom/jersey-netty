jersey-netty
============

Simple bindings for JBoss Netty enabling Jersey to be embedded as a handler in Netty's pipeline.
Regard this as alpha quality. Think twice before doing anything serious with it.

Getting started
----------

Use Maven to compile

    mvn install

See http://gist.github.com/261277 for an example of how to use it.


Will tr getting this onto a Maven repo if there's interest.
Hopefully either Jersey or Netty can include it as part of the official repository.
